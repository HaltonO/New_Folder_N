                <p style="font-weight: bold">AtUVic</p><p>A team of 5 members including myself worked on a project
                of sketching a mobile app, from low & medium fidelity to higher fidelity. To prototype, software such
                as Balsamiq, Sketch and Invision were used. The project included design aspects from evaluating usability, user
                experience and user testing. The app was aimed to increase engagement of students in campus
                through centralizing all events of the University of Victoria at one place.</p>
